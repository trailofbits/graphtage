Graphtage is a command-line utility and [underlying library](https://trailofbits.github.io/graphtage/latest/library.html)
for semantically comparing and merging tree-like structures, such as JSON, XML, HTML, YAML, plist, CSS files, and
flame graphs. Its name is a portmanteau of “graph” and “graftage”—the latter being the horticultural practice of joining
two trees together such that they grow as one.

## Installation

```console
$ pip3 install graphtage
```

## Command Line Usage

### Output Formatting
Graphtage performs an analysis on an intermediate representation of the trees that is divorced from the filetypes of the
input files. This means, for example, that you can diff a JSON file against a YAML file. Also, the output format can be
different from the input format(s). By default, Graphtage will format the output diff in the same file format as the
first input file. But one could, for example, diff two JSON files and format the output in YAML. There are several
command-line arguments to specify these transformations; please check the `--help` output for more information.

By default, Graphtage pretty-prints its output with as many line breaks and indents as possible.
```json
{
    "foo": [
        1,
        2,
        3
    ],
    "bar": "baz"
}
```
Use the `--join-lists` or `-jl` option to suppress linebreaks after list items:
```json
{
    "foo": [1, 2, 3],
    "bar": "baz"
}
```
Likewise, use the `--join-dict-items` or `-jd` option to suppress linebreaks after key/value pairs in a dict:
```json
{"foo": [
    1,
    2,
    3
], "bar":  "baz"}
```
Use `--condensed` or `-j` to apply both of these options:
```json
{"foo": [1, 2, 3], "bar": "baz"}
```

The `--only-edits` or `-e` option will print out a list of edits rather than applying them to the input file in place.

### Matching Options
By default, Graphtage tries to match all possible pairs of elements in a dictionary. While computationally tractable,
this can sometimes be onerous for input files with huge dictionaries. The `--no-key-edits` or `-k` option will instead
only attempt to match dictionary items that share the same key, drastically reducing computation. Likewise, the
`--no-list-edits` or `-l` option will not consider interstitial insertions and removals when comparing two lists. The
`--no-list-edits-when-same-length` or `-ll` option is a less drastic version of `-l` that will behave normally for lists
that are of different lengths but behave like `-l` for lists that are of the same length.

### ANSI Color
By default, Graphtage will only use ANSI color in its output if it is run from a TTY. If, for example, you would like
to have Graphtage emit colorized output from a script or pipe, use the `--color` or `-c` argument. To disable color even
when running on a TTY, use `--no-color`.

### HTML Output
Graphtage can optionally emit the diff in HTML with the `--html` option.
```console
$ graphtage --html original.json modified.json > diff.html
```

### Status and Logging
By default, Graphtage prints status messages and a progress bar to STDERR. To suppress this, use the `--no-status`
option. To additionally suppress all but critical log messages, use `--quiet`. Fine-grained control of log messages is
via the `--log-level` option.

### Specifying File Types

By default, Graphtage makes a best-effort guess of the input file types based upon file extensions and, in some 
cases, file contents. This is largely based off of the 
[Python `mimetypes` library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mimetypes.html#mimetypes.guess_type).

The input files' mimetypes can be explicitly specified using the `--from-mime` and `--to-mime` arguments.

#### Flame Graphs

Graphtage has support for diffing
[flame graphs](https://trailofbits.github.io/graphtage/latest/graphtage.flamegraph.html).
This is useful to identify performance regressions between program refactors, _e.g._, when control flow is modified or 
functions are added, removed, or renamed.

There are many libraries in different languages to produce a flame graph from a profiling run.
There unfortunately isn't a standardized textual file format to represent flame graphs.
Graphtage uses this common format:
```
function1 #samples
function1;function2 #samples
function1;function2;function3 #samples
```
In other words, each line of the file is a stack trace represented by a ``;``-delimited list of function names
followed by a space and the integer number of times that stack trace was sampled in the profiling run.

## Why does Graphtage exist?

Diffing tree-like structures with unordered elements is tough. Say you want to compare two JSON files.
There are [limited tools available](https://github.com/zgrossbart/jdd), which are effectively equivalent to
canonicalizing the JSON (_e.g._, sorting dictionary elements by key) and performing a standard diff. This is not always
sufficient. For example, if a key in a dictionary is changed but its value is not, a traditional diff
will conclude that the entire key/value pair was replaced by the new one, even though the only change was the key
itself. See [our documentation](https://trailofbits.github.io/graphtage/latest/howitworks.html) for more information.

## Using Graphtage as a Library

See [our documentation](https://trailofbits.github.io/graphtage/latest/library.html) for more information.

## Extending Graphtage

Graphtage is designed to be extensible: New filetypes can easily be defined, as well as new node types, edit types,
formatters, and printers. See [our documentation](https://trailofbits.github.io/graphtage/latest/extending.html) for
more information.
